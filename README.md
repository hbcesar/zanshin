The Zanshin Framework
=====================

This is a framework I'm developing in the context of my research on the design of adaptive systems, which started when I was a PhD Student at the [University of Trento, Italy](http://ict.unitn.it/) (for more information, see some of my [publications](http://disi.unitn.it/~vitorsouza/academia/)). The purpose of this framework is to facilitate the implementation of adaptive systems that follow our approach (which is also called _Zanshin_) in their design. This project also contains some simulations that use the framework.

For practical information on how to download and run _Zanshin_ or how to contribute to the project, please check out [our wiki](https://github.com/sefms-disi-unitn/Zanshin/wiki). If you have any questions, comments, or any other form of contribution, please [contact me](http://disi.unitn.it/~vitorsouza/).

The project's name -- _Zanshin_ -- refers to a "term used in the Japanese martial arts. It refers to a state of awareness" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanshin)). In episode 17 of the 6th season of the American television series [Friends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends), Ross uses "Unagi" instead of "Zanshin" to refer to this concept (and that's why the CASE Tool I'm also developing for the _Zanshin_ approach is called _Unagi_ ([see its repository here on github](https://github.com/sefms-disi-unitn/Unagi)).
