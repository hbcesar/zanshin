/**
 * ECA-based implementation of the Adaptation Service.
 * 
 * This implementation works with the ECA EMF Package and only handles AwReqs that belong to the EcaAwReq EMF Class
 * defined in that package's meta-model. EcaAwReqs are associated with one resolution condition (which indicates when
 * the problem represented by that AwReq has been solved) and one or more adaptation strategies (to try and solve the
 * problem). Moreover, adaptation strategies should contain an applicability condition, which indicate when they can be
 * executed to try and adapt to a given situation.
 * 
 * The ECA-based implementation considers AwReq state changes as the EVENT, Resolution and Applicability conditions as
 * the CONDITION and the execution of adaptation strategies as the ACTION. More details can be found in research papers
 * published by the author of this framework (see http://disi.unitn.it/~vitorsouza/academia/).
