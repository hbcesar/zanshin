/**
 * Interface that defines the Monitoring Service. This service is responsible for processing the target system's log,
 * identifying when there has been a change of state in an Awareness Requirement and notifying the Adaptation Service
 * about this change of state.
 * 
 * Monitoring works by processing calls to requirement life-cycle methods (such as start(), end(), success(), etc.) on
 * the requirement instances. This service is defined in a way such that it should be notified of calls to these
 * methods. Although such notification is not the responsibility of the monitoring service, it is suggested that the
 * bundle that provides an implementation to this service also handles this responsibility (e.g., using aspects to
 * intercept the method calls).
